# DC5B Protocol

Systematic decision making for DC5B

## Comms routines

> I picture a flow diagram, state machines, a system with queues, triggers and tasks that makes sending comms almost habitual.
>
> We need to do this and need to do it well so I think a designed system that we can evaluate, reason about and refine is the way to go.
>
> Don't get me wrong, the content must be heartfelt and real, but the routine is automatic. Feels like one of those examples where defining your own boundaries benefits your creativity within.

### Working draft

```mermaid
graph LR;
    E[External Communications] --> F[P1: Social media & marketing presence];
    E --> G[P2: Customer newsletters];
    E --> H[P3: Press releases];
    
    A[Internal Communications] --> B[P1: Regular team meetings];
    A --> C[P2: Internal messaging platform];
    A --> D[P3: Email updates];
```

P1 = highest priority based on impact on reputation, money-flow and productivity. _Maybe somekind of happiness index too?_
