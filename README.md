# DC5B Protocol

Systematic decision making for DC5B

## Comms routines

> I picture a flow diagram, state machines, a system with queues, triggers and tasks that makes sending comms almost habitual.
>
> We need to do this and need to do it well so I think a designed system that we can evaluate, reason about and refine is the way to go.
>
> Don't get me wrong, the content must be heartfelt and real, but the routine is automatic. Feels like one of those examples where defining your own boundaries benefits your creativity within.
